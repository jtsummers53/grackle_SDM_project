Summers J, Lukas D, Logan CJ, Chen N. The role of climate change and niche shifts in divergent range dynamics of a sister-species pair. In progress.
  - [grackle_SDM_project.Rmd](https://github.com/jtsummers53/grackle_SDM_project/blob/main/grackle_SDM_paper.Rmd) contains the most recent version of the manuscript for this study. Check the history of this document to view the track-edited changes to the manuscript.
  - [workflow.Rmd](https://github.com/jtsummers53/grackle_SDM_project/blob/main/workflow.Rmd) allows you to reproduce the analyses from this study. The document contains download locations for all raw datasets used, and intermediate and final resulting files can be found at this [KNB repository](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/view/urn%3Auuid%3A60291cb3-139e-43e2-ac8a-3182993b2e3f).
  - The code within workflow.Rmd can be modified to study how changes in climate and land use contribute to range dynamics within a bird species with observations on eBird. Following the instructions on workflow.Rmd can also be used to model changes in connectivity over large species ranges using Circuitscape 4.0.
